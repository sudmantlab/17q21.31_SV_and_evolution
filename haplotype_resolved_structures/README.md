Principal bundle sequences (e.g. `0.0-3.0-7.0-4.0-8.0-5.0-6.0-2.0-4.1-7.1-2.1-5.0-6.0-2.0-4.1-7.1-2.1-5.0-6.0-2.0-1.0`) are encoded as bundle identities separated by hyphens. Each bundle (indicated by a number) is referred to by its identifier (a number) followed by a . and then a 0 or 1 indicating it's orientation (direct or inverted respectively)
